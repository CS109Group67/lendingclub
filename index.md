LendingClub (LC) is the largest peer-to-peer lending platform where borrowers apply for loans and investors review loan applications to fund. The details of how this marketplace works are available on [LendingClubâ€™s website](https://www.lendingclub.com "LC Homepage")

For each loan that meets the platform underwriting criteria, LC provides investors with information about the *loan characteristics* (interest, term, purpose, etc.), *borrower demographics* (state, income, home ownership, etc.) and *borrower credit history* (balances, delinquencies, fico score, etc.) to aid investment decisions and strategy. As part of this marketplace, LC makes the [historical loan data](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action "LC Data Download") freely available online. The data is updated quarterly and we accessed the data as of the 2018 Q2 update.

Our project goal was to *create a data-driven model to power a profitable and ethically responsible LC investment strategy*. We carefully analyzed the LC marketplace in order to:
- select features that meaningfully influence loan outcomes
- devise an investment strategy and identify key variables driving the investment decisions
- calculate the expected risk and return profile of the investment strategy
- assess the predictive quality of the model
- evaluate ethical implications and evidence of discrimination resulting from the proposed investment strategy

The contents of the report are structured as follows:
1. Data Description:
2. Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing
3. Modeling
4. Investment Strategy
5. Ethical Implications
