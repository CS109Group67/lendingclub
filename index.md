[LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com "LC Homepage") (LC) is a peer-to-peer lending platform where borrowers apply for loans and investors select loan applications to fund. Investors can review **loan characteristics** (interest, term, purpose, etc.), **borrower demographics** (state, income, home ownership, etc.) and **borrower credit history** (balances, delinquencies, fico score, etc.) for each loan that meets the platform's underwriting criteria. Historical LC loan data is freely [available online](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action "LC Data Download") and updated each quarter.

Our project goal was to **create a data-driven model to power a profitable and ethically responsible LC investment strategy**. We carefully analyzed LC loan data in order to: discern features that significantly influence loan outcomes; devise an investment strategy based on the key variables; calculate the expected risk and return profile of the investment strategy; assess the predictive quality of the model; and evaluate ethical implications and evidence of discrimination resulting from the proposed investment strategy

The contents of our report are structured as follows:
1. **Data Description**: summary of the datasets we used in service of our project goals
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing**: exploration and processing of the data
3. **Modeling**: classification and regression models to evaluate meaningful loan features
4. **Investment Strategy**: proposed investment strategy and risk-return profile
5. **Ethical Implications**: investigation of discrimination in LC's practices and our investment strategy
