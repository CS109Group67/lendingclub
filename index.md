[**LendingClub (LC)**](https://www.lendingclub.com "LC Homepage") is the largest peer-to-peer lending platform where borrowers apply for loans and investors review loan applications to fund. For each loan that meets LC underwriting criteria, investors can view information about the **loan characteristics** (interest, term, purpose, etc.), **borrower demographics** (state, income, home ownership, etc.) and **borrower credit history** (balances, delinquencies, fico score, etc.). The LC historical loan data is freely available online[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action "LC Data Download") and updated quarterly.©˙√∫

Our project goal was to **create a data-driven model to power a profitable and ethically responsible LC investment strategy**. We carefully analyzed the LC marketplace in order to: discern features that significantly influence loan outcomes; identify key variables driving the investment decisions and devise an investment strategy; calculate the expected risk and return profile of the investment strategy; assess the predictive quality of the model; and evaluate ethical implications and evidence of discrimination resulting from the proposed investment strategy

The contents of our report are structured as follows:
1. **Data Description**: summary of the datasets we used in service of our project goals
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing**: examination each loan feature to determine and perform relevant preprocessing
3. **Modeling**: classification and regression modeling to determine meaninful loan features for
4. **Investment Strategy**: results of the modeling and implications for the investment strategy
5. **Ethical Implications**: Investigation of discrimination in LC’s practices and ultimately our proposed investing strategy
