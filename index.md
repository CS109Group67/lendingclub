title: Lending Club Data-Driven Investing
---



LendingClub (LC) is the largest peer-to-peer lending platform where borrowers apply for loans and investors review loan applications to fund. LC provides investors information about the loan characteristics (interest, term, purpose, etc.) borrower demographics (state, income, home ownership, etc.) and borrower credit history (balances, delinquencies, fico score, etc.) to aid investment decisions.

The goal of our project is to build a data-driven model to power a profitable and ethically responsible LC investment strategy. This involved:
- selecting features in the loan data that meaningfully influence loan outcomes
- explaining the strategy and identifying the key variables driving the investment decisions
- calculating the expected risk and return profile of the investment strategy
- assessing the predictive quality of the model
- evaluating ethical implications and evidence of discrimination resulting from the proposed
investment strategy
