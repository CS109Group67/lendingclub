[**LendingClub (LC)**](https://www.lendingclub.com "LC Homepage") is the largest peer-to-peer lending platform where borrowers apply for loans and investors review loan applications to fund. For each loan that meets LC underwriting criteria, investors can view information about the **loan characteristics** (interest, term, purpose, etc.), **borrower demographics** (state, income, home ownership, etc.) and **borrower credit history** (balances, delinquencies, fico score, etc.) to aid investment decisions. LC makes [historical loan data](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action "LC Data Download") freely available online. It is updated quarterly and we accessed it as of 2018 Q2.

Our project goal was to *create a data-driven model to power a profitable and ethically responsible LC investment strategy*. We carefully analyzed the LC marketplace in order to: select features that meaningfully influence loan outcomes; devise an investment strategy and identify key variables driving the investment decisions; calculate the expected risk and return profile of the investment strategy; assess the predictive quality of the model; and evaluate ethical implications and evidence of discrimination resulting from the proposed investment strategy

The contents of the report are structured as follows:
1. **Data Description**: Summary of the datasets we used in service of our project goals
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis & Preprocessing**: Examination each loan feature to determine and perform relevant preprocessing
3. **Modeling**: Classification and regression modeling to determine meaninful loan features for
4. **Investment Strategy**:
5. **Ethical Implications**: Investigation of whether there is discrimination in LCâ€™s practices and ultimately our proposed investing strategy
