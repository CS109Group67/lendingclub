### CS109A | Fall 2018 | Tiffany Chang, Michal Propas, Elliot Trilling


### Motivation:

[LendingClub (LC)](https://www.lendingclub.com "LC Homepage") is a peer-to-peer lending platform where borrowers apply for loans and investors select loans to fund. Investors can review the borrower's credit history (balances, delinquencies, inquiries, etc.), demographics (state, income, home ownership, etc.) and loan characteristics (interest, term, purpose, etc.) for each application that meets the platform's underwriting criteria. Historical LC loan data is freely [available online](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action "LC Data Download") and updated each quarter.


### Project Statement:

Our goal was to *propose, build and evaluate data-driven modeling to power a profitable and ethically responsible LC investment strategy.* As if we were working as data scientists advising a LendingClub investor, we performed the following:
- [Data Description](https://cs109group67.github.io/lendingclub/DataDescription.html): summary of the datasets
- [EDA & Cleaning](https://cs109group67.github.io/lendingclub/EDA.html): data exploration, cleaning and feature design
- [Modeling](https://cs109group67.github.io/lendingclub/Models.html): modeling to discern an investment strategy
- [Investment Strategy](https://cs109group67.github.io/lendingclub/): investment strategy and evaluation of its predictive quality
- [Ethical Implications](https://cs109group67.github.io/lendingclub/EthicalImplications.html): investigation of discrimination in the investment strategy and LC's underwriting practices
