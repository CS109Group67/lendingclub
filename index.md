### CS109A Final Project - Fall 2018 -  Group 67 - Tiffany Chang, Michal Propas, Elliot Trilling

<br>

**Motivation**:

LendingClub[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.lendingclub.com "LC Homepage") (LC) is a peer-to-peer lending platform where borrowers apply for loans and investors select loan applications to fund. Investors can review loan characteristics (interest, term, purpose, etc.), borrower demographics (state, income, home ownership, etc.) and borrower credit history (balances, delinquencies, fico score, etc.) for each loan that meets the platform's underwriting criteria. Historical LC loan data is freely available online[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.lendingclub.com/info/download-data.action "LC Data Download") and updated each quarter.

<br>

**Problem Statment**:

Our goal was to *propose, build and evaluate a data-driven model to power a profitable and ethically responsible LC investment strategy.* As if we were working as data scientists advising a LendingClub investor, we performed the following:
- Analyzed LC data to discern features that influence loan outcomes
- Performed classification and regression modeling to formulate sound LC investing principles
- Devised an investment strategy, calculated its risk-return profile and assessed its predictive quality
- Evaluated ethical implications and evidence of discrimination resulting from the proposed investment strategy
